# KotlinMultiPlatformPlayground
A playground project to test Kotlin Multiplatform on Android and iOS.

This repo contains two projects, one for iOS and one for Android. It also contains a Kotlin multi-platform library called "multiplatform-core", which is shared and imported by both projects.

This is a companion repository for my series of articles on learning Kotlin Multiplatform to share code between iOS and Android.
